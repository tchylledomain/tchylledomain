<br>Hi there,</br>
my name is Marcylle, I'm a CyberSec student.
I'm currently learning/have learned:
  - Windows and Linux Server
  - Windows and Linux Hardening
  - AD
  - Database (Microsoft SQL, MySQL DB, Oracle Database and MongoDB) <- currently here</br>

I hope to use this to document how I solve some CTF problems.
